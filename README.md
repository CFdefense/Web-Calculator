# Web Calculator
This project is a calculator application hosted on a website, it performs basic calculator mathematics using HTML and CSS for the front-end and Javascript for the back-end.

## Purpose
I started on this project to familiarize myself with how a HTML and CSS front-end interacts with a javascript back-end. It was a very simple project but provided me crucial basic experience with how these languages interact and function in unison.
